How to add Monster Pack:

1) Drag Monster pack from Project folder into the Hierarchy

2) In the Hierarchy, right click the Monster Pack. Go to Prefab > Unpack Completely

3) Delete any camera already in the scene (there is a camera in the Monster Pack).

4) Optional: Add the NavMesh 
	- NavMesh is used for the AI to path the monster
	- The monster will go through all objects without a NavMesh
	- The clue and weapon system works without it but will give a console warning


How to add the NavMesh

1) Make sure all objects that should not be walked through are "Static"
	- It's the checkbox next to the object name in the Inspector
	- Apply to all children
	- Static tells the NavMesh to make the AI avoid those objects

2) At the top bar go to Window > AI > Navigation

3) After clicking a Navigation window/tab appears 
	- (Mine appears next to the Inspector Window)

4) Within the Navigation window, click the Bake tab

5) On the Bake Tab, click the "Bake" button

6) Loads for a few seconds/minutes then good to go


Optional: Adjust AI pathing
- Within the Navigation tab you can adjust the AI object size if it's too small/big

- Settings that affect where the AI can go:
	- Agent Radius 
	- Agent Height
	- Max Slope
	- Step Height
